Warning message:
In tsglm.meanfit(ts = ts, model = model, xreg = xreg, link = link,  :
  The sum of the estimated serial dependence parameters is very close to the
boundary value one. This is a plausible estimation in the presence of very
strong serial dependence. However, this could also point to a nonstationarity
of the process which has not been taken into account, e.g. a trend. Please
 check results carefully.

Warning messages:
1: In tsglm.distrfit(meanfit, distr = distr) :
  The dispersion parameter of the negative binomial distribution cannot be
estimated. This indicates that there is no or only very little overdispersion
in the data. The Poisson distribution with argument 'distr' set to "poisson"
was fitted instead.
