# HONR499 Thesis Project

This repository contains all the work associated with my senior thesis project for the CSU Honors Program and my capstone project for DSCI 478. It is entitled 'Inference on Hippocampal Connectivity Using Multi-Trial Count-Valued Time Series.' The repository is organized as follows:  
- `Batch`: Contains the batch request scripts used on the Summit HPC servers to execute model fitting scripts.  
- `Data`: Contains raw data and binned version of data.  
- `Models`: Contains all fitted models saved as .rds files.  
- `Optimize`: Contains saved results from the optimization cross-validation procedure.  
- `Output`: Contains output and error messages from executing the model fitting scripts.  
- `Plots`: Contains all saved result plots used for paper and presentation.  
- `Scripts`: Contains model fitting and utility scripts.  
  
The thesis paper itself and the original paper from which the data were sourced are included as .pdf files.
