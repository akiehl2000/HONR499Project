# HONR499 Thesis Project

This repository contains all the work associated with my senior thesis project 
for the CSU Honors Program. It is entitled 'Inference on Hippocampal Neural 
Structure Using Longitudinal Count-Valued Generalized Linear Models.' The 
repository is organized as follows:  
- `Batch`: Contains the batch request scripts used on the Summit HPC servers
to execute model fitting scripts.  
- `Data`: Contains raw data and binned version of data.  
- `Models`: Contains all fitted models saved as .rds files.  
- `Optimize`: Contains saved results from the optimization cross-validation 
procedure.  
- `Output`: Contains output and error messages from executing the model fitting
scripts.  
- `Scripts`: Contains model fitting scripts.
